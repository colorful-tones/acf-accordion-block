# Accordion block using ACF fields

An accessible accordion block that uses ACF fields. The interactivity of the accordion comes from [10up's Component Library](https://baseline.10up.com/component/accordion/).

## Accessibility (a11y)

ARIA is added with JavaScript. The recommended markup allows for avoiding keyboard trap, which can often trip of keyboard navigation and other input devices.

If JavaScript is enabled then the accordion items are all expanded and accessible by default.

Also, there are several handy key binding to enable easier navigation, e.g. `home`, `end`, `up` and `down` arrow.
